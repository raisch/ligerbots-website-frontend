# ligerbots-website-frontend

This is the repo for the new Ligerbots website, a work in progress.

Contact Coach Rob on slack if you're interested in helping.

## Directory Structure
- /bin - useful scripts (probably out-of-date)
- /src - site components (svelte)
  - lib
    - /components - svelte componentry
      - /icons - useful icons as svelte components
        - Note: Sourced from svelte-icon-pack, might wish to use a better pack, like
          lucide-svelte
      - *.svelte - site components
        - Note: Most of these are just html ripped from existing site and should be refactored
          into actual components. To do so, we'll need to decide on a site wide css layout
          library. The existing site uses an old version of bootstrap which is sub-optimal.
    - /server - server-side javascript
  - routes - sveltekit routes

- /system - boilerplate and instructions for installation on a ubuntu linux service machine

## Architecture

This site is built using [`sveltekit`](kit.svelte.dev) which is a leading-edge, standards-compliant framework
for building web sites. (Under the covers, it uses the standard [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) running
on top of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en).)

`sveltekit` is powered by
- [`vite`](https://vitejs.dev/) which provides all the tooling required to build and serve your site or app, and
- [`svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) which is a compiled, component-based framework (a little like React but
  much faster and lighter) that allows you to combine business logic (in Javascript), content layout/organization
  (in HTML), and presentation styling (in CSS) into discrete 'components' you can use to build your web pages.

For example, the base for all the pages on this site looks like:

```
<head />
<body data-sveltekit-preload-data="hover">
  <div style="display: contents">
    <App>
      <slot/>
    </App>
  </div>
</body>
```
where the `<App>` tag is defined as:
```
<div id="header-ghost"></div>

<div class="container-fluid no-side-padding" id="page-container">
  <div class="col-xs-12 no-side-padding">
    <Masthead />
    <Navbar />
    <MainPane>
      <slot /> <!-- where anything between <App> and </App> will be inserted. -->
    </MainPane>
    <Footer />
  </div>
</div>
```

As you can see, by breaking pages into a hierarchy of components, you gain concision of expression and a high level
of reuse.

## Note On The Use Of `<embed>` Tags
The `<embed>` tag defines a container for an external resource, such as a web page, a picture, a media player, or a plug-in application.

We use the `<embed>` tag to embed active `SVG` elements in a page; active in this sense means they encapsulate
images, links, and styles in the same object.

Our use of the tag is to support images which have "clickable regions" within them.

<div style="color:red">But our use of this tag for this purpose poses both significant security issues for
browsers and violates the contract browsers have with page content.</div><br/>

A far better way to accomplish the same functionality, and one that does not pose as much risk as SVGs, is to
use individual `<img>` tags wrapped in `<a>` anchor tags which then rely on the standard page formatting
tools to manage their position on the page.
