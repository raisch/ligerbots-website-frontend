# Carpool System Use Cases

## Overview
The Ligerbots website carpool system enables team members to organize transportation<br/>
to and from robotics events. The system is built with SvelteKit and follows a hierarchical<br/>
structure: Events ‚Üí Trips ‚Üí Rides ‚Üí Riders.

## System Architecture
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit pages and components
- **Backend**: Directus CMS with GraphQL API
- **Route Structure**: 
  - `/carpool` - List all active carpool events
  - `/carpool/create` - Create new event (admin only)
  - `/carpool/admin` - Admin dashboard for vehicle management
  - `/carpool/[id]` - Event details with associated trips
  - `/carpool/[id]/edit` - Edit event details (admin only)
  - `/carpool/ride/[id]/[triptype]` - Trip details with rides
  - `/carpool/ride/[id]/[triptype]/edit` - Edit trip details (admin only)
  - `/carpool/ride/[id]/[triptype]/vehicle` - Vehicle/ride management
  - `/carpool/vehicle/[id]` - Individual vehicle details

## Data Model Hierarchy
```
Event
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Basic Info (name, description, dates, location)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Trips[]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ destination_trip (to event)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ return_trip (from event)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Rides[]
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Vehicle info (type, name, seats)
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Driver details
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Riders[]
```

## Global Business Rules

### GBR-001: One Seat Per Trip Type Limitation
**Rule**: No user can reserve more than one seat per trip type within the same event.

**Details**:
- A user may reserve at most **one seat** in all `destination_trip` rides for an event
- A user may reserve at most **one seat** in all `return_trip` rides for an event
- Users cannot join multiple rides of the same trip type (e.g., cannot join two different "to event" rides)
- System must validate and prevent multiple reservations during the join process
- If a user attempts to join a second ride of the same type, system should display error message

**Enforcement Points**:
- `POST /api/triprides/[id]/join` - Validate no existing reservation for trip type
- Frontend ride selection interface - Disable "Join" buttons for same trip type
- Admin interface - Display warnings for duplicate reservations

---

### GBR-002: Mandatory Opt-Out Requirement
**Rule**: If a user doesn't wish to ride in one direction, they MUST explicitly opt-out from all trips in that direction.

**Details**:
- Users who don't need transportation in a specific direction must actively opt-out
- Opt-out prevents the user from accidentally being assigned or considered for rides
- Opt-out must be recorded per trip type (destination_trip vs return_trip) per event
- System should track opt-out status and display it clearly in user interfaces
- Users can change their opt-out status, but it requires deliberate action

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Add opt-out status field to user-event-trip relationships
- Create opt-out API endpoints: `POST /api/events/[id]/trips/[triptype]/opt-out`
- Create opt-in API endpoints: `POST /api/events/[id]/trips/[triptype]/opt-in`
- Display opt-out status prominently in trip listings
- Require opt-out confirmation dialog to prevent accidental selection

**Enforcement Points**:
- Event detail pages must show opt-out options for each trip type
- Ride management interfaces must respect opt-out status
- Admin dashboards should display opt-out statistics
- Notification systems should exclude opted-out users from ride announcements

---

### GBR-003: Business Rule Validation Matrix

| Scenario | Destination Trip | Return Trip | Action Required |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| User wants both directions | Join 1 ride max | Join 1 ride max | Normal operation |
| User wants destination only | Join 1 ride max | **MUST opt-out** | Explicit opt-out required |
| User wants return only | **MUST opt-out** | Join 1 ride max | Explicit opt-out required |
| User wants neither direction | **MUST opt-out** | **MUST opt-out** | Explicit opt-out required |
| User joined destination ride | ‚úÖ Joined | Available to join 1 OR opt-out | System tracks status |
| User opted out of destination | ‚ùå Opted out | Available to join 1 OR opt-out | System prevents join attempts |

2. User identifies they need transportation in a specific direction (to event OR from event)
3. User clicks "Quick Reserve" or "Reserve Next Available" button for desired trip type
4. System validates Global Business Rules:
   - Check user hasn't already reserved a seat for this trip type (GBR-001)
   - Verify user hasn't opted out of this trip type (GBR-002)
5. System searches for next available seat using algorithm:
   - Query all rides for the specified trip type and event
   - Filter rides with available seats (current riders < vehicle capacity)
   - Sort by priority criteria (departure time, ride creation date, etc.)
   - Select first available seat from prioritized list
6. System automatically assigns user to the selected ride
7. System sends confirmation with ride details (vehicle, driver, departure info)
8. System updates available seat count for assigned ride

**Alternate Flows**:
- **No Seats Available**: System displays "No available seats for [trip direction]. Please check back later or contact admin."
- **Already Reserved**: System shows "You already have a reservation for this trip direction" (GBR-001)
- **User Opted Out**: System shows "You have opted out of this trip direction. Please opt-in first." (GBR-002)
- **Multiple Equal Priority**: System selects based on secondary criteria (alphabetical vehicle name, etc.)

**Algorithm Details**:
```
FastReservationAlgorithm(eventId, tripType, userId):
1. availableRides = getRidesWithAvailableSeats(eventId, tripType)
2. if (availableRides.isEmpty()) return "NO_SEATS_AVAILABLE"
3. prioritizedRides = sortByPriority(availableRides, criteria=[
     earliestDepartureTime,     // Prefer rides leaving sooner
     mostSeatsRemaining,        // Prefer rides with more availability  
     creationDate,              // Prefer established rides
     vehicleName                // Tie-breaker: alphabetical
   ])
4. selectedRide = prioritizedRides[0]
5. addUserToRide(selectedRide.id, userId)
6. return rideDetails(selectedRide)
```

**Business Rules**:
- Must comply with GBR-001 (one seat per trip type per event)
- Must comply with GBR-002 (cannot reserve if opted out)
- Algorithm prioritizes optimal seat distribution across available rides
- Users receive detailed confirmation of their assigned ride
- System maintains audit trail of fast reservation assignments
- Fast reservations are treated identically to manual ride selections

**UI/UX Considerations**:
- "Quick Reserve" buttons prominently displayed next to each trip direction
- Loading state while system finds and assigns seat
- Clear confirmation modal showing assigned ride details
- Option to view/modify reservation after fast assignment
- Fallback to manual selection if user prefers specific ride

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented

## Technical Notes

### Current GraphQL Schema Usage
The system uses complex GraphQL queries to retrieve nested data:
- Events contain trips (destination_trip, return_trip)
- Trips contain rides with vehicle and driver information  
- Rides contain participant details with user information
- User data includes contact info and profile photos
- New server modules: Event, TripRide, Ride classes with dedicated methods
- GraphQL queries centralized in `/lib/server/graphql/event.js`
- Enhanced error handling and debugging throughout API layer

### Fast Reservation Algorithm Implementation
- **Performance Considerations**: Algorithm must efficiently query and sort available rides
- **Caching Strategy**: Consider caching available seat counts to reduce database queries
- **Concurrency Handling**: Implement optimistic locking to prevent race conditions during reservations
- **Priority Weighting**: Algorithm criteria should be configurable (departure time vs. seat availability)
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when no seats available or algorithm fails
- **Audit Trail**: Log all fast reservation decisions for analysis and debugging

### Authentication Requirements
- User authentication via sessionStorage for ride participation
- Admin privileges verified through `user.is_admin` flag
- Admin-only routes automatically redirect non-admin users
- Driver verification needed for ride creation and management
- Session-based authentication integrated throughout admin interface

### Notification System Requirements
- Email notifications for ride changes
- SMS notifications for urgent updates
- In-app notifications for ride coordination

### Mobile Considerations
- Responsive design for mobile access
- Touch-friendly interface for ride selection
- Quick access to driver/rider contact information
